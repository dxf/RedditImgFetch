# RedditImgFetch
Python tool to fetch a random image from any subreddit. BETA

## Usage

Modify the Python file to the subreddit you want to grab an image from (this currently only works with image only subs like r/pics, support for partially-picture subreddits to be added)
Run the file/skid the code into your own app and modify the variables as needed. Please credit me though <3
