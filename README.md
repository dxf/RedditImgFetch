# RedditImgFetch
Python tool to fetch a random image from any subreddit. BETA

## Usage

Modify line 4 of main.py after /r/ to point to the subreddit you want to grab an image from.
Run the file/skid the code into your own app and modify the variables as needed. Please credit me though <3
Honestly, I'm leaving the code really open ended so it can be modified really easily.

### Dependencies

Python 3
urllib3
json
